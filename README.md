# Peak (Divide & Conquer)
Consider an array of n values that has this property: The values in the array increase up to some index p, 0â‰¤p<n-1, and then decrease for all indices beyond p through n-1. 
Problem: Find the value p at which the peak occurs. Read input values from a 'peak.txt' file as integers, one per line.<br>
